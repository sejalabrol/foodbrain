# Food Brain
A culinary student's dream! This is a Flash Card game made in python that displays cooking terms and their meanings from [The Scramble](https://www.thescramble.com/glossary-of-cooking-terms/) to help the user learn and memorize them.
At the end of each session, it sends the user a summary - the words they learnt and the number of words they are yet to go through, by an SMS sent with [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).
